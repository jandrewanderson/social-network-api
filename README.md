# social-network-api

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a program using node.js that will allow the user to interact with a database created to manage information for different users on a social media platform. There are several models and routes that all interact in many ways with each other. This activity was to be executed with in Insomnia, which allows the user to interact with the data.

## Installation

Simply download the file from my github repo. After that, open the terminal for the folder that you copied from my repo. Once the terminal is open, type npm install. This will allow you to have all of the necessary packages to run my program (ie. Mongoose, express). 

## Usage

Open the terminal in this folder. Type npm start to allow the server to connect and for the local machine to be listening to the proper routes. Within insomnia, you will be able to run each of the routes go through all of the CRUD method; Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

If you have other Questions you can refer to the video or refer to my GitHub profile.
